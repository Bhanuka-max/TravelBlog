        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I've always traveled a bit around Italy with my family when I was a child.
             I enjoyed it but I always looked at those trips like basic holidays, like
              the one everyone does to escape from their boring life so I always had a 
              very distort vision on how traveling really looks like. In fact, as 
            a teen, I always looked at journeys simply as a way to relax and switch
             off</p>

                1. The planner: 10-day Golden Route in Japan
The person who has spreadsheets for everything and sleeps better 
when plans are scheduled months in advance.

Japan is a planner’s paradise. Trains arrive to the second,
 everything opens and closes exactly when advertised, and thi
 s personality type will thrive in the respectful order to daily life here. The classic 10-day Golden Route hits Japan’s highlights with clockwork precision, running from Tokyo’s subway system and world-class restaurants to meticulously maintained bamboo groves and temples in Kyoto. Then it’s on to Nara's deer-filled parks and Osaka's legendary food scene before ending in Hiroshima's moving peace memorials and Miyajima’s floating shrine.

The Japan Rail Pass handles seamless bullet train connections,
 and everything can be booked months ahead. Japanese culture rewards preparation. Imagine how excited your planner will be when researching basic etiquette, like how to use chopsticks correctly or the polite way to queue so they can blend in with locals.

             <p>2. The people pleaser: Palma de Mallorca solo
The person who always says yes, then panics, and who prioritizes other people’s wants and needs at their own expense.

People pleasers need a break from themselves – wandering at their own pace without accommodating anyone else, sidling up to a cafe without checking their companions' food preferences, sleeping in or staying out based on how they alone feel. Palma de Mallorca is ideal for this type of trip. The relaxed Balearic island pace and late-night dining culture mean that plans can change at the last minute without upsetting anyone. Travelers can shed their nervous energy with an early-morning cortado and ensaïmada (a sweet bread) at Ca’n Joan de s’Aigo, then wander the Sa Calatrava quarter’s medieval alleys and the trendy sea-facing neighborhood of Santa Caterina. Later they can ring the bell at Santa Clara Convent to buy the nuns’ famous lemon biscuits before visiting the city's staggering Gothic cathedral and grazing their way around Mercat de l’Olivar. When a change of pace is required, the vintage wooden train to Sóller takes a scenic 27km (16-mile) journey through citrus orchards and the dramatic Tramuntana mountains.

The beauty of Mallorca – or indeed Spain generally – for the people pleaser is complete flexibility. Restaurants welcome solo diners, meals run late, and the Spanish siesta culture allows them to rest without feeling guilty.</p>

    3. The early adopter: Europe's overlooked destinations
The person who loves anything that no one has heard of and needs to try it first.

These trailblazers don't want to follow the crowd so send them to a destination that's often overlooked by tourists. Direct them to Brno instead of Prague for underground bars, Bauhaus architecture and a culture-packed calendar of events year-round; or Dinant instead of Bruges for medieval streets, Gothic architecture, and canal rides without the throngs. They might be tempted by Leipzig over Berlin, where they can enjoy bar-strewn neighborhoods, quirky galleries, independent boutiques and crumbling foundries repurposed as creative centers. Cádiz is another good pick and a great alternative to Seville; it's Europe’s oldest city and one of Spain's coolest coastal destinations, with Phoenician roots and stunning Atlantic beaches.

Each destination offers world-class sights without queues, plus your pioneer traveler will have plenty of bragging rights: "Oh, have you not been to Brno yet?" And it's cool mixed with convenience because the infrastructure of each of these cities matches that of major capitals in terms of airports, rail connections and excellent hotels.
